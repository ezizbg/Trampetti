        If your business feels harder than it should… it is.
      </p>
      <ul class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">
        <li>Drowning in emails, texts, and tasks</li>
        <li>Fixing the same mistakes over and over</li>
        <li>Frustrated with inconsistent staff performance</li>
        <li>Tired of redoing work and chasing people</li>
        <li>Spending too much on admin and overhead</li>
        <li>
          Stuck working <strong>in</strong> the business instead of
          <strong>on</strong> it

      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-3">
        <strong>This is not a tech seminar.</strong> This is a
        <strong>business intervention</strong> using AI and systems to fix
        what's broken.

        Good people fail inside bad systems. AI finally gives small business
        owners the power to:
      </p>
      <ul class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-3">
        <li>Standardize how work gets done</li>
        <li>Stop relying on "that one good employee"</li>
        <li>Reduce rework, errors, and miscommunication</li>
        <li>Create clarity for the team — in writing</li>
        <li>Automate tasks that drain time and energy</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-4">
        We'll show you how to use AI as your assistant, process writer, policy

        sidekick.

      <h2 class="fade-in-up">What You'll See (Live in the Room)</h2>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-1">
        In this 2-hour, no-fluff session, you'll watch us use AI to:
      </p>
      <ul class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">
        <li>
          Build <strong>30 days of social posts</strong> for a real business in
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a <strong>vacation policy</strong> for a 10-person company in
          under 10 seconds
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn a messy idea into a
          <strong>clean standard operating procedure (SOP)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Write <strong>customer service replies</strong> your team can copy and
          paste
        </li>
        <li>
          Draft a <strong>job description</strong> that attracts better
          applicants
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-3">
        We'll even take a few
        <strong>real problems from the audience</strong> and fix them live on
        screen.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-4">
        You'll walk away knowing exactly what AI can do for your size business,
        where to plug it into your operations, and how to get more from the
        people you already have.
      </p>

    <section class="fade-in-up">
      <h2 class="fade-in-up">What You'll Walk Away With</h2>
      <ul class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-1">
        <li>
          A clear understanding of
          <strong>where your business is leaking time and money</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          A practical view of <strong>what AI can handle today</strong> (no
          jargon)
        </li>
        <li>
          Real examples you can <strong>copy and adapt</strong> for your own
          company
        </li>
        <li>
          A short list of <strong>"do this first" moves</strong> to get an
          immediate win
        </li>
        <li>
          The option to get a <strong>free Trampetti "Chaos Audit"</strong> of
          your business
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">
        This isn't about robots or replacing humans. It's about
        <strong>making your existing team 2–3x more effective</strong> — and
        your life as an owner a lot easier.

      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">
        For 30+ years, Mike has helped business owners eliminate chaos, build
        smarter systems, improve margins, and get out of the daily grind. Now he
        uses AI as a <strong>force multiplier</strong> — not as a toy, but as a
        practical tool to simplify work and give owners their life back.

      <h2 class="fade-in-up">FAQ</h2>
      <h3 class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-1">
        Do I need to be good with technology?
      </h3>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-1">
        No. If you can send an email, you can use what we show you. This is
        built for non-technical owners.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">Will you be selling software?</h3>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-2">
        No. We'll show you tools and approaches — some free, some low-cost — but
        this is not a software pitch.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-3">
        Can I bring a manager or key staff member?
      </h3>
      <p class="fade-in-up fade-in-delay-3">
        Yes, absolutely. Just register them too so we can plan seating and food.
